#Open AI WHISPER HACKATON PROJECT

**Project made for OpenAI Whisper hackaton from LabLab.Ai in colaboration with my friend @EnacheAdrian12.**  
Our prototype take an input question from the user when pressing the microphone button, recording his voice. After stopping the recording, the input question  will be transcriped and answered with the help of OpenAi Whisper and GPT3.  
We used **React, Flask, Python, OpenAi Whisper, GPT3 and REST APIs** to make this prototype.
